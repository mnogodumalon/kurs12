The brief must include:\n\n- App analysis and user understanding\n- Visual identity and distinctive design elements\n- Complete theme with fonts and colors (as hsl() values)\n- Separate mobile and desktop layouts\n- Component specifications with data sources\n- Complete data model with JSON schema\n- CSS variables ready to copy\n- Implementation checklist\n\nKey principles I must follow:\n- **App Store quality** - would Apple feature this?\n- **Light theme** but distinctive, not generic\n- **Layout creates visual interest** - avoid identical boxes\n- **One clear hero element** that stands out\n- **Avoid forbidden fonts** (Inter, Roboto, etc.)\n- **Extensible data models** - separate apps for user-managed categories\n- **Full CRUD for every app** - this is interactive, not read-only\n- **Primary action button required** - what users do most\n\nI'm ready to receive requirements and explore the codebase to create a detailed design specification.
