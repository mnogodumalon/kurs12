I can see the comprehensive project documentation in CLAUDE.md that outlines the process for implementing React dashboards with Living Apps backend.\n\nI notice you have a system in place that:\n- Uses a design_brief.md as the single source of truth for all design decisions\n- Creates Living Apps from a data model defined in that brief\n- Generates TypeScript types and services automatically\n- Follows strict implementation rules to match the design exactly\n\nSince this is a warmup, I'm ready for your actual task. What would you like me to help you with? Would you like me to:\n\n1. **Explore and plan** for a new feature implementation?\n2. **Review** existing code against the design brief?\n3. **Design** an implementation strategy for specific requirements?\n4. Something else?\n\nJust let me know what you need, and I'll apply the appropriate exploration and planning approach based on the documentation and context provided."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5296,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5296,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXrp4naWbQ2Meb88RDMhB","type":"assistant","uuid":"e35a2fe5-af0e-4c13-bc18-8c235e6093b8","timestamp":"2026-02-06T12:26:09.422Z"}
